## Coherent imaging, source separation, remote sensing and industrial applications

This course is divided into two parts.

The first part introduces new concepts in the Image field, such as coherent imaging and multiplicative noise, source separation, using remote sensing applications as a unifying theme (SAR imaging - synthetic aperture radar, multispectral optical imaging, hyperspectral imaging). The lectures are supported by numerous practical exercises using Jupyter notebooks.

The second part focuses on industrial applications of image processing and analysis, with presentations given by professionals from various companies on topics including biometrics, photography, nondestructive testing, and autonomous vehicles.
